# DESKTOP_AUDIO_SYSTEM
Want high-quality sound on your desktop? If you place 4 inch speakers in wooden boxes and put a high-quality amplifier, instead of the usual "computer speakers" you can get a great sound with a multitude of settings for relatively small money. At the same time you can practic in programming for Arduino!

> Version 2.5 released. In this version, I did not find errors. All functions work. 
> Version 2.7 released. The FM radio call button is changed. For the remote control no changes.
> Version 2.8 is available for download. Main differences from version 2.7:
- Added the ability to adjust the audio signal inside the radio receiver control.
- Added the ability to turn off - turn on the functions of amplification of bass for the radio.
- Fixed insignificant errors.
I made 2 options for compilation including for the budget Chinese microcontroller and Arduino.
