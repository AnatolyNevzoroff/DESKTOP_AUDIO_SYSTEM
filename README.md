# DESKTOP_AUDIO_SYSTEM
Want high-quality sound on your desktop? If you place 4 inch speakers in wooden boxes and put a high-quality amplifier, instead of the usual "computer speakers" you can get a great sound with a multitude of settings for relatively small money. At the same time you can practic in programming for Arduino!
