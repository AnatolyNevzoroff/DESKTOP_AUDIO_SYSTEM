# DESKTOP_AUDIO_SYSTEM
Want high-quality sound on your desktop? If you place 4 inch speakers in wooden boxes and put a high-quality amplifier, instead of the usual "computer speakers" you can get a great sound with a multitude of settings for relatively small money. At the same time you can practic in programming for Arduino!
Version 2.5 released. In this version, I did not find a single error. All functions work. Unlike version 2.5 in version 2.7, the FM Radio menu call button is changed. Now there is no separate switching knock between headphones and power amplifier, this button performs a function of calling a radio receiver. There are no changes for the remote control.
